                      I started my journey with DietGhar approximately 45 days
                      back when I was 78 Kgs and today I am 70 Kgs with DietGhar
                      team support and diet plan. The way they give diet plans
                      which are very easy to follow. I never feel hungry with
                      loads of variety and the kitchen planner is always handy
                      as I don't need to think what needs to be cooked.
